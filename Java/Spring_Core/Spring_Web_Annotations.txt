In spring to create web application we use following annotations:

1. @Controller
2. @RequestMapping 
3. @ResponseBody
4. @ModelAttribute

Limitations:
1.Web application are created by using Servelts,HTML,JSP which does not support PUT,DELETE operations
2. In Web Apps we write front-end and backend code in single project which makes maintanence very challenging and lots of dependency.
3. As a Java Developer we need to focus on frontend part also which is not our job.
4. We not only deal with data/business logic but also need to deal with unnecessary frontend work.
5. The frontend code cannot be reuse by other applications.
