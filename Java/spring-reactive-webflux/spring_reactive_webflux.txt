Spring Boot â€“ Reactive Programming Using Spring Webflux Framework
Last Updated : 06 Feb, 2024
In this article, we will explore React programming in Spring Boot, Reactive programming is an asynchronous, non-blocking programming paradigm for developing highly responsive applications that react to external stimuli.

What is Reactive Programming
In reactive programming, the flow of data is asynchronous through push-based publishers and subscribers instead of synchronous pull-based calls.
The core abstraction in reactive programming is the reactive stream which provides a standard way to work with asynchronous streams of data. The two primary reactive stream interfaces are Publisher and Subscriber.
Publishers push data to Subscribers asynchronously. Subscribers register callbacks and are notified when new data arrives instead of actively polling for it.
Examples of reactive streams include Mono and Flux in Spring Webflux. 
Mono represents a single event/value and Flux represents a stream of multiple values.
